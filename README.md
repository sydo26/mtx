# MTX

This project is being developed for study purposes for the subject of Linear Algebra in my undergraduate program. I'm trying to assimilate some of the functionalities of the [Octave tool](https://octave.org/), where I aim to build a CLI and also a library.

## MTX CLI

Command-line interface (CLI) for matrix operations written in Rust, located in the workspace within the [./cli](./cli/) folder, where the package name is `mtx-cli`.

### Use --package with package name

#### Run

```bash
cargo run --package mtx-cli
```

#### Build

```bash
cargo build --package mtx-cli
```

#### Test

```bash
cargo test --package mtx-cli
```
